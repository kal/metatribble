		<h1>Development Metatribble Script Installer</h1>
		<p>This page allows you to install the development version of the metatribble commands. </p>
		<p>If it is not already installed, there should be a message displayed at the top of this tab in Firefox prompting
		you to subscribe to this command. You should only do this if you intend to hack on the metatribble Ubiquity
		commands.</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b> we deliberately install the commands as dev-metatribble and dev-open-calais-key to avoid
		conflicting with the "official release" version of metatribble, so you can safely have both development
		and release version installed side-by-side.</p>
